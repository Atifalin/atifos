# AtifOS

AtifOS is an interactive, OS-style personal resume built using React, inspired by macOS 26's Liquid Glass design. Instead of a traditional resume, users interact with a desktop-like environment where each "app" explores part of your story: work, skills, photos, projects, etc.

## üéØ Key Features

- **OS-Like Experience**: A complete desktop environment with apps, dock, and window management
- **Adaptive Design**: Seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Mini-Me Assistant**: Floating cartoon assistant to guide users
- **OpenAI-Powered Terminal**: Interactive terminal for resume exploration
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, translucent interface inspired by macOS

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / SCSS + Glassmorphism
- **Animation**: Spline (boot/logo), GIFs (Mini-Me), Framer Motion
- **3D Effects**: Three.js (desktop background parallax)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (resume-aware terminal)
- **Hosting**: Vercel / Netlify

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## üì± Adaptive UX Strategy

AtifOS is built with two UX modes:

1. **Full OS Mode** (desktop/tablet)
   - Fully immersive desktop environment
   - Draggable/resizable app windows
   - Animated dock, boot screen, and 3D background

2. **Mobile OS Mode** (smartphones)
   - Adaptive app-style layout (like a mobile OS launcher)
   - Full-screen panels instead of draggable windows
   - Chat-style interface for terminal
